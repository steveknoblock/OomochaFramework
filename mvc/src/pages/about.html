		 <p>Welcome. We expect our site will become operational within the next month and its features come online gradually. For now, you may read about our ideas. We thank you for your patience while we continue our "soft launch" designed to allow feedback to shape our site.

<p><strong>What is FarmFoody and why did we create it?</strong>
</p>

<p>FarmFoody is a (and we believe the first) social networking site for farmers and consumers of farm goods. We felt there was a need for a website that reflected the social character of interactions between farmers and the people who consume their products as well as "foodies" sharing with each other about the farms and fresh foods they love.
</p>

<p><strong>Why the silly name?</strong>
</p>

<p>We chose the name of our site for its whimsical character as well as its apt description of our mission.
</p>

<p><strong>Why put the "farm" in "farmfoody?"</strong>
</p>

<p>We believe that freshest and highest quality ingredients can only be found where they are created, the farm. The farmer is an integral part of the creative process leading from the farm, to the chef and to your dinner table, which should not be ignored. We believe consumers should have the opportunity for a personal relationship with their farmer, and that farmers should hear from the consumer.</p>


<p><strong>Who created FarmFoody? Steve Knoblock and Tom Davenport.</strong>
