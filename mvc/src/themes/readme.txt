The themes directory contains files that must visible to the web server. The location of this folder is hardwired into the framework, since it makes no sense to move it outside the public web tree.

The files are stylesheets and images or any other files that pertain only to the presentation or appearance of web pages generated by the framework.


Templates correspond to modules. Since each module is independent, it is impossible to correlate it with a "theme." Thus they are in a separate directory, which may be outside the public web tree (given they are never accessed directly over the web, but processed by the template engine first).
